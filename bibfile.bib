Telos is then introduced as a conceptual modelling language designed for capturing knowledge about information systems and it is argued that, unlike its peers, it offers facilities not only for modelling an application but also the notions used to model an application. The presentation of features of the language is eclectic and generally non-technical. Details about Telos can be found in [Mylopoulos90] and [Koubarakis89]},

abstract = {Efficient management of RDF data is an important factor in realizing the Semantic Web vision. Performance and scalability issues are becoming increasingly pressing as Semantic Web technology is applied to real-world applications. In this paper, we examine the reasons why current data management solutions for RDF data scale poorly, and explore the fundamental scalability limitations of these approaches. We review the state of the art for improving performance for RDF databases and consider a recent suggestion, "property tables." We then discuss practically and empirically why this solution has undesirable features. As an improvement, we propose an alternative solution: vertically partitioning the RDF data. We compare the performance of vertical partitioning with prior art on queries generated by a Web-based RDF browser over a large-scale (more than 50 million triples) catalog of library data. Our results show that a vertical partitioned schema achieves similar performance to the property table technique while being much simpler to design. Further, if a column-oriented DBMS (a database architected specially for the vertically partitioned case) is used instead of a row-oriented DBMS, another order of magnitude performance improvement is observed, with query times dropping from minutes to several seconds.},

@article{Carvalho2017,
abstract = {Since the late 1980s, there has been a growing interest in the use of foundational ontologies to provide a sound theoretical basis for the discipline of conceptual modeling. This has led to the development of ontology-based conceptual modeling techniques whose modeling primitives reflect the conceptual categories defined in a foundational ontology. The ontology-based conceptual modeling language OntoUML, for example, incorporates the distinctions underlying the taxonomy of types in the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) (e.g., kinds, phases, roles, mixins, etc.). This approach has focused so far on the support to types whose instances are individuals in the subject domain, with no provision for types of types (or categories of categories). In this paper we address this limitation by extending the Unified Foundational Ontology with the MLT multi-level theory. The UFO-MLT combination serves as a foundation for conceptual models that can benefit from the ontological distinctions of UFO as well as MLT's basic concepts and patterns for multi-level modeling. We discuss the impact of the extended foundation to multi-level conceptual modeling.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017. Aviation is a high risk industry where safety management is mandatory for organizations. On a global scale, safety management is hierarchical, i.e. national authorities manage safety of the sector, controlling organizations which in turn manage safety of their operations, as well as the safety of their organizational units. It is apparent that safety information management is a key factor to the success of safety management. Improving safety information management in aviation can be achieved by the systematic documentation of safety information and its seamless sharing vertically as well as horizontally through the management hierarchy. Despite attempts to tackle this problem, the industry still suffers from information management issues, e.g. usage of ter-minologically incompatible safety management frameworks. As a result diverse information repositories, e.g. investigation reports, safety recommendations, or audit reports managed by these frameworks, cannot be efficiently explored and compared. We apply Linked Data principles, e.g. searchability and explorability based on dataset descriptors, to help solving the problem. In this work we propose an ontology-based safety information management for the aviation industry. To achieve this we develop the Aviation Safety Ontology that is modular and covers the contexts of the organization types aerodrome, airline, air traffic management, maintenance and the state civil aviation authority. We test the appropriateness of the proposed ontology by representing safety data in terms of the ontology.},

abstract = {Abstract Efficient management of RDF data is an important prerequisite for realizing the Semantic Web vision. Performance and scalability issues are becoming increasingly pressing as Semantic Web technology is applied to real-world applications. In this paper, we examine the reasons why current data management solutions for RDF data scale poorly, and explore the fundamental scalability limitations of these approaches. We review the state of the art for improving performance of RDF databases and consider a recent suggestion, property tables. We then discuss practically and empirically why this solution has undesirable features. As an improvement, we propose an alternative solution: vertically partitioning the RDF data. We compare the performance of vertical partitioning with prior art on queries generated by a Web-based RDF browser over a large-scale (more than 50 million triples) catalog of library data. Our results show that a vertically partitioned schema achieves similar performance to the property table technique while being much simpler to design. Further, if a column-oriented DBMS (a database architected specially for the vertically partitioned case) is used instead of a row-oriented DBMS, another order of magnitude performance improvement is observed, with query times dropping from minutes to several seconds. Encouraged by these results, we describe the architecture of SW-Store, a new DBMS we are actively building that implements these techniques to achieve high performance RDF data management.},

Particularly, a number of authors have been investigating approaches to extend the expressivity beyond what is currently supported by the DL (Description Logics) based languages in order to address this issue, while maintaining compatibility with subclasses of DLs adopted in the Semantic Web. This is mainly due to the increasing popularity of the Semantic Web initiative as well as the role played by DL in that context. In this paper we defend the need of a higher-level foundational framework based on results coming from the discipline of Formal Ontology. We present two complementary proposals for modeling temporally changing information in OWL, based on the most discussed strategy in the literature to address this problem, namely, the use of a perdurantist (or 4D) view of domain entities. Moreover we compare the results with some related work and discuss its limitations and further improvements.},

In the OBDA paradigm, an ontology defines a high-level global schema of (already existing) data sources and provides a vocabulary for user queries. An OBDA system rewrites such queries and ontologies into the vocabulary of the data sources and then delegates the actual query evaluation to a suitable query answering system such as a relational database management system or a datalog engine. In this chapter, we mainly focus on OBDA with the ontology language OWL 2QL, one of the three profiles of the W3C standard Web Ontology Language OWL 2, and relational databases, although other possible languages will also be discussed. We consider different types of conjunctive query rewriting and their succinctness, different architectures of OBDA systems, and give an overview of the OBDA system Ontop.},

abstract = "Enterprise Architects can use the ArchiMate{\circledR} language to model Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and security concepts and relationships. This widely accepted open standard provides the modeling constructs to describe and interconnect business and technical architectures. Applying the ArchiMate language to represent risk and security concepts results in the ideal vehicle to consider these aspects in an integral way. The ArchiMate language fits well with other Enterprise Architecture (EA) frameworks and standards, such as the TOGAF{\circledR} standard and the Zachman framework, as well as enterprise security management frameworks such as the Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA). Through its Motivation extension, the ArchiMate language makes it possible to link control measures to security requirements, principles, and goals, as well as to the results of a risk analysis. On the other hand, ArchiMate models can be linked to design languages for business processes and IT solutions such as BPMN and UML. These linkages enable precise gathering of a set of broadly accepted risk and security concepts, analysis of their semantics, and consensus regarding the most important ones of the full scope of enterprise risk.This White Paper, a joint project of The Open Group ArchiMate Forum and The Open Group Security Forum, demonstrates this approach and identifies opportunities for future work that would enhance it.",

In this paper, the problems European Coordination Centre for Accident and Incident Reporting Systems users face during occurrence reporting are discussed, as well as subsequent searches in reported occurrences.

Moreover, this problem also delays the transfer of the i* framework to industrial settings. Our work is one of the current attempts to promote interoperability among the existing variants, and it does that by investigating the semantics behind the i* core concepts. For that, we apply a foundational ontology named UFO, which is used as a semantically coherent reference model to which the language should be isomorphic. In this paper, we report on the steps we have pursued, what we have accomplished so far, also setting the context for the work ahead.},

title = "Modeling enterprise risk management and security with the ArchiMate language",
abstract = "Enterprise Architects can use the ArchiMate{\circledR} language to model Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and security concepts and relationships. This widely accepted open standard provides the modeling constructs to describe and interconnect business and technical architectures. Applying the ArchiMate language to represent risk and security concepts results in the ideal vehicle to consider these aspects in an integral way. The ArchiMate language fits well with other Enterprise Architecture (EA) frameworks and standards, such as the TOGAF{\circledR} standard and the Zachman framework, as well as enterprise security management frameworks such as the Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA). Through its Motivation extension, the ArchiMate language makes it possible to link control measures to security requirements, principles, and goals, as well as to the results of a risk analysis. On the other hand, ArchiMate models can be linked to design languages for business processes and IT solutions such as BPMN and UML. These linkages enable precise gathering of a set of broadly accepted risk and security concepts, analysis of their semantics, and consensus regarding the most important ones of the full scope of enterprise risk.This White Paper, a joint project of The Open Group ArchiMate Forum and The Open Group Security Forum, demonstrates this approach and identifies opportunities for future work that would enhance it.",

@article{Abdulkhaleq2015,
abstract = {STPA (Systems-Theoretic Processes Analysis) is a new hazard analysis technique based on STAMP. STPA is already being used in different industrial domains (e.g. space, aviation, medical or automotive). To support the application of STPA and make using STPA more efficient, we developed an open tool called A-STPA. However, the current usage of ASTPA by safety analysts in different areas shows a number of shortcomings in terms of documenting unsafe control actions, drawing different levels of control structure diagrams, documenting the causal factors in STPA Step 2 and supporting the application of STPA in different areas. In this paper, we present an extensible STAMP platform called XSTAMPP as tool support designed specifically to serve the widespread adoption and use of STPA in different areas, to facilitate STPA application to different systems and to be easily extended to include different requirements and features. Moreover, XSTAMPP has the potential to be extended in the future to support the application of CAST for accident analysis. We believe that XSTAMPP is a useful first step toward establishing a base platform to support the application of STAMP methodologies in different domains.},
